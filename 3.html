    <p> Oh-oh, ooh
        You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round throwin' that dirt all on my name
        'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
        You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round every party in L.A.
        'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
        I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
        You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh
        And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
        But you're not coming home with me tonight
